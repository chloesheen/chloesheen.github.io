				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p><br>Hey there! I'm Chloe.<br><br>I'm in my first year of pursuing a MSE in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, following
					my recent graduation from Bryn Mawr College with a B.A. in Computer Science.

					<br><br>Amongst the variety of interdisciplinary CS courses offered at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges,
					I was fortunate enough to explore a speech synthesis and recognition course coupled with a computational linguistics course,
					which provided an extensive exploration of the intersection between linguistics and artificial intelligence.
					Applying the linguistic knowledge into building various tokenizers and parsers to observe the uses of each in processing
					data further kindled my interest in software development.

					<br><br>Outside of Bryn Mawr, I taught web development at Hill Top Preparatory
					 for students with disabilities using various forms of text-to-speech technology on a daily basis. Despite the assistance these software provided, observing some of the major limitations of these programs fanned the
					 flames of my wish to utilize my skills in programming to better assistive technology. This prompted me to work with the nonprofit Rahul Kotak
					 Foundation, based in Kenya, to create an Android application to assist the illiterate or disabled cooks to cook appropriate amounts of githeri
					 each day without having to read attendance charts or travel to each of the classrooms.

					 <br><br>With the power of computing, I aim to create assistive and accessible user experiences for those who rely on such technology in ways that help
					 differently abled and less fortunate populations around the world. I would like to further my skills in programming and provide better context and
					 intuition to face these challenges, and I look forward to working alongside the brightest minds at Penn.

					<br><br>As an avid writer and musician, I have also previously worked as a newspaper reporter, editorial columnist, and symphony orchestra violinist.
					Relevant portfolio is available upon request.
