				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p><br>Hey there! I'm Chloe.<br><br>I'm in my first year of pursuing a MSE in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, following
					my recent graduation from Bryn Mawr College with a B.A. in Computer Science.

					 <br><br>With the power of computing, I aim to create assistive and accessible user experiences for those who rely on such technology in ways that help
					 differently abled and less fortunate populations around the world. I would like to further my skills in programming and provide better context and
					 intuition to face these challenges, and I look forward to working alongside the brightest minds at Penn.

					<br><br>As an avid writer and musician, I have also previously worked as a newspaper reporter, editorial columnist, and symphony orchestra violinist.
					Relevant portfolio is available upon request.
