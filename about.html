				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p><br>Hey there! I'm Chloe.<br>I'm in my final year of studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Bryn Mawr College.
					<br><br>This past month, I have been teaching web development at
					<a href="http://hilltopprep.org/student-life/hill-top-summer-camp/">Hill Top Preparatory School</a>
					for high school students with learning disabilities along with an introductory programming course in Python, my favorite language!
					On top of teaching, I have been doing research in speech synthesis using
					<a href="http://festvox.org" target="_blank">Festvox</a> under the advisement of Jane Chandlee at Haverford College.
					In previous years, I worked as a software developer at an educational platform
					<a href="http://lem.ma" target="_blank">Lemma</a>,
					a project manager at the Educational Technology department at Bryn Mawr, and as an instructor with
					<a href="www.techgirlz.org/">TechGirlz</a>.
					<br><br>As an avid writer and musician, I have also previously worked as a newspaper reporter, editorial columnist, and symphony orchestra violinist.
					Relevant portfolio is available upon request.
